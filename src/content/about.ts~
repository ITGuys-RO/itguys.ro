      "ITGuys was founded by Catalin Teodorescu, a Senior Web Security Engineer with over 15 years of experience spanning cybersecurity, full-stack development, and DevOps. After working at companies like Electronic Arts and TUI, and spending nearly 7 years building software for Swiss clients, one thing became clear: most agencies pick their favorite stack and bend every project to fit it.",
      "We do the opposite. Your product deserves the right foundation, not a convenient one. Whether that means PHP, Node, Python, or something else entirely depends on what you're building and who's using it.",
      "Our background in security isn't separate from our development work. It's built into how we think about architecture, write code, and deploy systems. When you've spent years finding vulnerabilities in other people's software, you learn to build yours differently.",
